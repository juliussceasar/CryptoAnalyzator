It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. The Dursleys
bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then,
because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they
could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It wasn’t bad, either,
Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked
remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn’t blond.
Harry had the best morning he’d had in a long time. He was careful to walk a little
way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting to get
bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn’t fall back on their favourite hobby of
hitting him. They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because
his knickerbocker glory didn’t have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought
him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first.
